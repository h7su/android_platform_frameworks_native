Does not build.\nI can\u0027t figure out a way to do this call. \n\nCalling `parcel-\u003eget()-\u003eresizeOutVector` gives an error:\n`member access into incomplete type \u0027const AParcel\u0027`.\n\nWhat I can\u0027t figure out is a way to access libbinder parcels from binder_parcel_utils. The original thought would have been through NDK parcel.cpp, however the function would need to be defined as is currently done. Any thoughts?",
