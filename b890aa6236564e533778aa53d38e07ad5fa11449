      "message": "The AIDL compiler emits the equivalent C++ code directly into the auto-generated code, but I added it here instead because it doesn\u0027t fit cleanly into Rust\u0027s on_transact (Rust uses the ? operator which exits from on_transact early in case of error).\n\nI could rename the auto-generated on_transact to on_transact_inner and add a new auto-generated on_transact with the code below, but I\u0027m not sure that makes sense.",
