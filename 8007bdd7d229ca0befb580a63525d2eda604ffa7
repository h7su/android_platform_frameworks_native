      "message": "This CL is a cherry-pick of you original CL on internal master: https://googleplex-android-review.git.corp.google.com/#/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/2212184/\n\nAs I noted in my previous comment, this CL should have been cherry-picked to AOSP before https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/485664/ , this is my mistake. Because opengl/tests/lib/include/EGLUtils.h was created as a new file (due to the new path) in the previous cherry-pick, in this cherry-pick the old version of EGLUtils.h at opengl/tests/include/EGLUtils.h appears as Deleted. So although it seems that EGLUtils.h no longer exists in the source code in this CL, EGLUtils.h does exist in aosp-master under lib/include/ (https://cs.corp.google.com/aosp-master/frameworks/native/opengl/tests/lib/include/EGLUtils.h?sq\u003dpackage:%5Eaosp-master$\u0026dr\u003dCSs)\n\nThese CLs are an effort to match the code sync between internal master and AOSP, to the extent that it is required for VNDK development on AOSP.",
