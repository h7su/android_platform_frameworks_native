      "message": "Intiutively, I don\u0027t see why granting servicemanager access to additional CPUs could make this freeze/crash more likely. \n\nIn b/316829336, in the cpuinfo section, servicemanager used only 6% of the cpu, while system_server used 182%. It might actually be that servicemanager was starved, hence this change could have helped.\n\nI agree that the platform is complex enough so a change like this could cause an unexpected result but I don\u0027t think that delaying it would help us understand the problem better. \n\n@zezeozue@google.com, since you have more experience with ANRs, can you share your thoughts on the issue?",
