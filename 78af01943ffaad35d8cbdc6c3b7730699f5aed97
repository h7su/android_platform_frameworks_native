      "message": "this CL appears to both include and exclude checks. Can you be more specific about what this CL is doing?\n\nSpecifically - it no longer catches all tidy checks, implying that if a new reasonable category of checks is added, we would have to know this and add them. However, this isn\u0027t expected. If we keep \u0027*\u0027 and exclude any problematic checks in the future, we will be guaranteed to take advantage of all new checks and have a mechanism which tells us of bad new checks.",

      "message": "We\u0027re not going to allow the use of `*` in much the same way that we don\u0027t let allow the use of `-Weverything`. These are not intended for production use, and while you can use them to see new areas for improving your code, adding them to the default build is a no-go. If you want to test your particular code with new checks, you need to set up and maintain your own separate build (automated or manual) to do so. Otherwise, every compiler update causes issues as newer (usually overly stringent) checks force us to have to fix your not-actually-broken code.",

Now it should contain only the selected check groups, minus known warnings of specific checks in each group.\nYes, the principle is that we could use wildcard \"*\" to include all tidy checks in default to get more warnings, but should not use \"*\" to treat all new checks as errors.

The new setting is what we use in nightly builds to find all new checks. We did find new tidy check groups like altera-* as soon as we upgrade AOSP prebuilt clang-tidy and then decide if we want to disable it or fix new warnings.\n\nAs long as in a project local .bp file, there is no \"-*\" to disable all checks, new checks will appear as a warning. As usual, project .bp files can enable/disable more checks. Only \"*\" is not good to include in the tidy_checks_as_errors list.\n\nAt https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html, we can see every group and every check. We are seeing more new and noisy groups added every year, e.g, altera-*, modernize-*, llvmlibc-*. The non-noisy groups are stable and becoming the minority.
