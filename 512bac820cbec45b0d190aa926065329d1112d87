      "message": "As another idea, have you considered a one-shot service triggered by init for doing the relabeling of /data/data and /data/user ? The one-shot service could reuse the existing relabeling code in init, and the service could be triggered by system_server when packages.list is in a fixed state.\n\nIt might be easier to implement too, which is nice.",
