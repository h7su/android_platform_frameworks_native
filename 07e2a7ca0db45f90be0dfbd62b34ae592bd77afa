We probably can\u0027t use `std::expected` since that\u0027s only in C++23, is there anything else?\n\nI\u0027d really prefer if we kept the error code since the caller might want to do different things depending on what the code is, but if we have no way of doing it right now then we can remove it now and add it back later.",
