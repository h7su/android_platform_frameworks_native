      "message": "can I suggest that you run the shutdown trigger setup here once instead of in the two implementations of \u0027connectAndInit\u0027, where it would be setup on L489?\n\n(note - there is one case where this function gets called twice - in setupInetClient, if L489 fails, then it will try another address, so setting up the shutdown trigger needs to be re-entrant. I have b/189955605 to clean this up, but actually I started changing this function so that if it failed, it would clean up the state, but I just simply don\u0027t care to do so - it is easier to create a new RpcSession object than to program in something trying to turn an error state into a good state)",
