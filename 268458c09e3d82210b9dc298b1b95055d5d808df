      "message": "Sure, but that AParcel will internally point to C++ `Parcel`s allocated on the stack, right? I\u0027m talking about buffer and reply from IPCThreadState::executeCommand (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/master/libs/binder/IPCThreadState.cpp#1249) which get wrapped by `AParcel`s (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/master/libs/binder/ndk/ibinder.cpp#179) and then passed to Rust. This means that Rust indirectly holds pointers to C++ objects on the stack. Am I missing something here? Both buffer/data and reply seem to be passed by reference or pointer, respectively.\n\nI think a pointer to a pointer to a C++ stack object is still not safe to send between threads.",
