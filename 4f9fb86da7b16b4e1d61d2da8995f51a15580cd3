      "message": "this comment seems to suggest that multiple AIBinder\u0027s for a given class is a bug, but that\u0027s not really true. A basic example would be a unique AIBinder for each client connection. It would then be important to not give the same client 2 different AIBinder\u0027s, but it\u0027s also important to give each client a different AIBinder. Multiple binder instances of the same class is also used as simply a transaction id, where each transaction has a new instance to get a new id.\n\nI think these comments can be tweaked to more document the useful property of pointer equality without being quite so prescriptive on a particular usage.",
