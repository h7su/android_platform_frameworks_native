I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth the effort of trying to get libfeature_support_angle.so to build again (it may be a simple fix), since I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027ll ever want/need it in the future anyway and the APK size reduction is a nice benefit too.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

If it takes more than a day or two, I may ask to land this CL so the rest of my work can continue while I clean up the full change.",
