      "message": "I don\u0027t think ignoring SIGPIPE at the application level is an option in general for Android because of the amount of code or processes we might be intertwined with (some users of this may want it). I want this code to be non-global and self-contained, and I don\u0027t want it to be interacting w/ random other things that are using SIGPIPE.\n\n\u003e It\u0027s odd for a library to squash SIGPIPE itself and override the application\u0027s wish.\n\n:) couldn\u0027t disagree more, but I also expect I am probably missing something here. What is so great about this global signal? :)",

It\u0027s basically a workaround for early UNIX programs failing to check write() errors. Had cat checked write() errors, it would have worked just fine. Now it\u0027s just some ridiculous thing we have to turn off in every complex UNIX program, just like exiting \"real mode\" in an x86 processor.\n\n(There isn\u0027t even a standard way in POSIX to suppress it on an individual fd.
