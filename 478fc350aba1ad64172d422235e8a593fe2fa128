But the 1MB is kinda arbitrary (and questionable - who said this Parcel came over Binder in the first place?)\n\nBut also it looks like something a simple helper could just as easily do, not something AParcel needs to provide?\n\nAlso since there\u0027s an extra readInt here, is there a missing write-equivalent of this?",
