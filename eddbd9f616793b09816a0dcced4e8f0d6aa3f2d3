      "message": "Hey Peiyong,\n\nThis change is to allow EGL/GLES drivers to be loaded from \"sphal\" namespace as well as from the fixed location (e.g. /vendor/lib/egl). This means that graphics libraries can be loaded from a vendor apex if the apex is a part of \"sphal\" namespace. In the topic, a new graphics APEX with graphic drivers is created for demonstration.\n\nPlease take a look.",

      "message": "There are a couple things that we are moving towards: 1) We are trying to reduce the paths where the graphics driver exists and hence reduce the time to search them; 2) We are trying to move to use ANGLE as the default GLES and by that time the GLES driver will only have one path `/system/${LIB}`; 3) the library name must be fixed, e.g. it must be `libxxx_${ro.hardware.egl}.so`",
