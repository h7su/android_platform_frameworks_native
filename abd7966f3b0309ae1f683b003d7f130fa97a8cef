This latest patch set is unrelated to the initial stuff in this CL... the testing I had initially was really close the Default testing I was doing and just kept amending this commit with this Change-Id. But, I removed all that and went with a very simple test case in binderRpcTest instead.",

You can debug seeing how many refcounts are added here by calling \u0027myDelegate-\u003egetStrongCount()\u0027 - I would expect it to be 1 here\n\nOne other possibility is that there is a leak somewhere else.",
