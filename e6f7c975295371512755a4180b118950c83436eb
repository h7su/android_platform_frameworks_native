      "message": "Drive-by (since I\u0027m still getting some notifications and saw these extension names):\n\nIf the extension names haven\u0027t been set in stone yet, it would be good if the full name of one wasn\u0027t a valid substring of the other.\n\nThis is based on the issues we saw with the framebuffer fetch extension names:\n\n    GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch\n    GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch_non_coherent\n    \nApps would check for `GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch` in the list of supported extension names by checking substring rather than full string matches.   This led them to incorrectly believe that ANGLE supported `GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch` since `GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch` is a substring of `GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch_non_coherent`.   While this is a bug in the app, it still caused some pain for ANGLE development.   It would be good to prevent it for other extensions if it\u0027s possible to rename these in a way that still makes sense.",
