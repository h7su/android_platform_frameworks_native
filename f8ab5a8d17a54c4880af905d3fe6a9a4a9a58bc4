It will only be possible to increase the threadpool size (unless you pipe through arguments through addServer, but I would say focus on getting the test done w/ the larger threadpool).\n\nYou can see an example of how to force it to go to the max in ThreadPoolGreaterThanEqualRequested in binderRpcTest (lock, many threads trying lockUnlock which will run in parallel, then unlock).",
