      "message": "Hmmm. Actually, this is quite strange. I\u0027m not quite sure where this comes from. I suspect that readInt32 is returning zero in an error case (no data left on the parcel). Not quite sure why this was copied here. Maybe Ruchir knows. I don\u0027t see it elsewhere.\n\nProbably we could improve the story when b/149100166 is fixed.\n\n\nDoes \u0027cmd\u0027 work with/without this? I\u0027m assuming/hoping that it doesn\u0027t. If it does work with this though, maybe let me know, since I think there might be a bug in Parcel.",
