      "message": "IIUC, libselinux is llndk, which would make any addition something that we must support forever. I wanted to test the water with the approach. And to your other question on vendor logs, I was thinking:\n1. land this change for the platform only,\n2. land another change to enable the same logging for vendor (we can always revert this change if we overlooked something vendor-specific).\n3. Once this has settled a bit, refactor and move the function to libselinux.\n\nWDYT?",
