# This is an example of part of a key character map file for an alphanumeric
# thumb keyboard.  Some keys are combined, such as `A` and `2`.  Here we
# specify `number` labels to tell the system what to do when the user is
# typing a number into a dial pad.
#
# Also note the special character '\uef01' mapped to ALT+SPACE.
# Pressing this combination of keys invokes an on-screen character picker.
