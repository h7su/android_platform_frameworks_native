//! Unsafe native interfaces to the C++ libbinder library. No user servicable

// Bindings to libbinder generated by bindgen. Ideally we should generate this
// at build time, as is done in the `build.rs` script. However, soong doesn't
// support `build.rs` yet so we pre-generate these bindings and check them into
// the repo. These bindings must be manually re-generated when the libbinder API
// changes.
