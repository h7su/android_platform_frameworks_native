If so, a comment explaining that would be helpful -- it\u0027s pretty subtle, and someone looking at this code wouldn\u0027t easily understand why it\u0027s needed.\n\nOr are you trying to protect against EGL14 not existing? I think we can just assume that, it\u0027s a required part of the platform.",
