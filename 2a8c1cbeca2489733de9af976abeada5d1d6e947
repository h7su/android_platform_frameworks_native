External storage may or may not support fs-verity, so I originally had this check to restrict on userdata partition for avoiding fragmentation (if app wants to use fs-verity on external storage).  But nowadays external storage is managed through FUSE, which does not support fs-verity ioctl. So it\u0027s probably not worth keeping this check.",
