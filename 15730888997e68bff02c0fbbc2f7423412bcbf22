      "message": "This isn\u0027t quite right, as I understand it. We create a `hwc` (in `Display::createOutputLayer`) for *all* visible layers (via `Output::collectVisibleLayers`), if the `Output` is backed by Hardware Composer (HWC).\n\nThis change would result in a new bug. If the `Output` is backed by HWC, `needsProtected` will now always be set to `false`.\n\nWhat you really want to know is whether the layer is going to be composited by the HWC or not. That information is actually contained by the `hwc` object.\n\nWhat I think you want is\n\n```\n    \u0026\u0026 (!layer-\u003egetState().hwc || layer-\u003egetState().hwc.hwcCompositionType \u003d\u003d\n        aidl::android::hardware::graphics::composer3::Composition::CLIENT);\n```\n\nThis method (`updateProtectedContentState`) is called after HWC specifies which layers should be `CLIENT` composited, so `hwcCompositionType` should be up to date. It does feel a *little* fragile, though - if we changed the ordering, this would break. So maybe we should have a test confirming the ordering?\n\nAnd we should have a test for this behavior change, too.",
