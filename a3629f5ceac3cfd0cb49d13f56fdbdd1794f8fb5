      "message": "Couple of questions\n1. What should we do in the event that a call to enumeratedevices returns a vk failure when querying for anb9 in driver.cpp? Returning false for support seems wrong, but there are no vulkan error codes that apply ?\n2. Did I do the pNext unchaining correctly? reinterpreting to VkSurfaceFormat2KHR and then to VkImageCompressionPropertiesEXT feels incredibly iffy\n3. I did the code presubmit and it\u0027s incredibly hard to read. Should I make simpler and upload w/o presubmit?",
