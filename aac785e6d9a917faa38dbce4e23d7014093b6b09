      "message": "We should support things in fuzzService directly, with as few options as possible. Most importantly, we want to keep fuzzer definitions as simple as possible. Though also:\n- other fuzzers will end up benefiting from AID_MEDIA being here.\n- the overall cost of adding more cases here should be low, due to coverage guided fuzzers behavior.\n- we can make improvements easily in one place.\n- it\u0027s easier to understand fuzzer coverage, because it will be produced by the same algorithm.\n- corpus generation algorithm will be simpler, and it\u0027ll be easier to keep track of these corpuses or update them.",
