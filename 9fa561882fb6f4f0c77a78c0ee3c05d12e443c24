I looked at s/Process/ExecutionContext/ so that it could optionally be a thread, but it\u0027s a bit heavy weight. I might try to make the pipe work across all of the types first, so that we can have one copy of code that creates the server. At that point, we can also avoid server-\u003eshutdown() wait loop because we can communicate with the server (after you talk to it, you know it\u0027s up).",
