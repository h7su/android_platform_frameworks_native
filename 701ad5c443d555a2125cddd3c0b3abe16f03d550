      "message": "Yes, the intention is to switch the inputs in a group (i.e. L100-125).  When I first tried to do that, I had to constantly scroll up and down literally 100, 200 lines part to understand how the variables were used.  I could simply add one extra condition in places, but I think that\u0027ll hurt readability more.  Yes, I really only need L100-125, but I thought the same change could improve readability in general.  Admittedly I don\u0027t know some of the semantics well enough.\n\n\u003e In some places it feels artificial and a bit detrimental to readability.\n\nI\u0027m more than happy to fix if you can point out the locations.  The intention is to improve readability, not make it worse :)",
