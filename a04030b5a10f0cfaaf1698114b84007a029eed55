      "message": "That\u0027s not the problem, the issue is something specific to the Trusty transport: we don\u0027t have threads so we don\u0027t block in `rpcRec`. There is one main event loop that blocks on all connections (with a call similar to `poll`). If any connection receives a new message, then the handler calls `drainCommands`.\n\nThe issue: on Trusty, if no message ever comes in, then `rpcRec` never gets called. The other way to detect shutdown is to call `rpcSend`, but on most services that never happens either without an incoming message.\n\nThe third way is what\u0027s happening in this patch: the main event loop can also detect when a connection has shut down. We handle that separately now. Otherwise, it would just wait forever for a message to come in.",
