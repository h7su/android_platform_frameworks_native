      "message": "Minor nit: might be useful to add a comment explaining how this test works, since it\u0027s a bit subtle. Afaict this is what happens:\n* Test client sends the first transaction (let\u0027s call it transaction A)\n* Service receives async A on thread 1 and calls `sendFdOneway` which blocks until the `recvFd` on 935 is called; since `sendFdOneway` hasn\u0027t returned yet, `RpcState` can\u0027t increment the async number\n* Test client sends transaction B\n* Service receives transaction B on thread 2 but since the async number hasn\u0027t been updated yet, it queues the transaction in `asyncTodo` and returns (this is what we\u0027re testing)\n* Client reaches 935 and calls `recvFd` which unblocks transaction A, which returns and updates the async number\n* Immediately after, `RpcState` pops transaction B and calls `sendFdOneway`\n* The rest isn\u0027t particularly important, but the test calls `recvFd` again to clear the `HandoffChannel`.\n\nDid I get the sequence right?",

      "message": "This is an aspect of binder threading - oneway transactions from the same thread to the same thread will be run in sequence.\n\nIn the case of this test \u0027numThreads\u0027 is really important - because RPC binder round-robins things rather than intelligently queueing things. So, that certain other configurations of this test would fail.\n\nI might recommend s/recvFd/unblockFd/ here or something - to emphasize that it is supposed to cause the oneway call to progress. Maybe mention the oneway calls are blocked, but an in-depth analysis as Andrei has put here - honestly I think we should document it publicly (b/238929598).",
