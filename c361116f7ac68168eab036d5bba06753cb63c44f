      "message": "Yes. I wasn\u0027t sure how \"android\" trusty is, so I made it include `OS_android.cpp`, but feel free to move stuff to `trusty/OS.cpp`. I even did this initially, but then realized that trusty\u0027s OS.cpp was the same as Android\u0027s (for these two functions).\n\nPTAL at Linux OS.cpp - maybe this one could be shared between Linux (non-android) and trusty?\n\nhttps://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/2616196/48/libs/binder/linux/OS.cpp\n\nEither way - I suggest to do this after all of Linux Binder is done, so we would know how much Linux, Android and Trusty would differ.",
