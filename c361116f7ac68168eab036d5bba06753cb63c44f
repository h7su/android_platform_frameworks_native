I even did this initially, but then realized that trusty\u0027s OS.cpp was the same as Android\u0027s (for these two functions).\n\nPTAL at Linux OS.cpp - maybe this one could be shared between Linux (non-android) and trusty?\n\nhttps://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/2616196/48/libs/binder/linux/OS.cpp\n\nEither way - I suggest to do this after all of Linux Binder is done, so we would know how much Linux, Android and Trusty would differ.",

There are some basic similarities between it and Linux, but a lot of stuff is different: Trusty has no threads, select/poll (it has a similar call named wait), fcntl, pipes, dynamic linking, and more (or less, if you will).\n\n\u003e I suggest to do this after all of Linux Binder is done\n\nAlright, that works. In the mean time, Trusty has some tests in Binder presubmit, so if anything breaks we can fix it as needed.",
