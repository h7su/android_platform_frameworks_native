EAFSUPPORT  is a special case here for something that\u0027s not really an error, and for the rest we can just treat  statusToString  as a black box (well most of, this code relies on it never returning  OK  or  EAFNOSUPPORT  for any error). Making  statusToString  return something specific for  EAFSUPPORT  would break its abstraction.",
