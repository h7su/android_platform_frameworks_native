      "message": "I considered renaming binder\u0027s `__assert` to something else, like `BINDER_FATAL_ERROR`, but stopped when I saw two places in binder defining `__assert`, only one of which had the `LOG_PRI` macro pragma push/pop code. I do still think we shouldn\u0027t be messing with reserved identifier like this, but this one-line fix seems to work well enough.\n\nFor all I know, we could just replace the `__assert` calls in binder with the ordinary convention, `assert(false \u0026\u0026 \"... error message to report ...\");`\n\n(FWIW: musl should be fine, because it doesn\u0027t define an `__assert` macro.)",
