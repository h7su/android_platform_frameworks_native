(clearer abort to clients, the stack will show when the invalid value is set - though from a code perspective, what we have now is cleaner because it doesn\u0027t depend on what the default value of mMaxIncomingThreads is).\n\nYou know what? How about aborting at the top of RpcSession::setupClient? That way, we would catch if a default value is set, and it\u0027s also early in the server setup.",
