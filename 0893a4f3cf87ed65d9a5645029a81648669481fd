      "message": "This function must be called only on a local binder and before that binder has been sent to another process. It is also not thread safe, while our Strong\u003cdyn Interface\u003e currently would be.\n\nI think we should at least only implement this on Binder\u003c\u003e (a local binder object). However, that would prevent calling this method on local Binder objects created, e.g. in the C NDK outside of Rust. Is this ok?\n\nRegardless, this method should be unsafe if we\u0027re going to expose it arbitrarily as it is not thread-safe and we want the rest of the API to be thread-safe.",

If `None` is\n    /// given, the implementation should fall back to using the PID\n    /// instead.\n\nThese docs also need updated. It\u0027s unsafe to rely on PID because of TOCTOU problems. They should also be amended to include information about calling set_requesting_sid. Can you also update this?\n\n\nBtw - I notice we could have caught all of this if the binder rust integration tests did use internal APIs like IBinderInternal. Is there any reason we have this dependency? or something else I\u0027m missing?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t have a great suggestion on how to expose this, which is why I hadn\u0027t done it yet. We could make it a method on the local native::Binder\u003c\u003e object, and provide a method on Strong\u003c\u003e to retrieve the local binder. But that still only handles half of this. Ideally, instead I would like to do this during object creation, which would require adding a new interface in the AIDL generated code for creating a new service with setRequestingSid set.",
