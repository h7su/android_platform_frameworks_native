      "message": "This is the right behavior when some piece of the code doesn\u0027t properly know how to handle the comm fd. It will provide the correct warning to higher-level code (that it will be unable to track the lifetime of the PFD). In the long run, we might want to support more of these features in native (by introducing something like \u0027readReliableFileDescriptor\u0027 or similar), but there isn\u0027t a big reason to now. Solution was proposed by jreck, and both him and I also talked to jsharkey about it.",
