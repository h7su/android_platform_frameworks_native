      "message": "There are three options for this:\n\n* Pass it in like this\n* Switch to source inclusion rather than building a library, and put this code next to the generated source\n* Use the library based bindgen version, and emit this as a string.\n\nIf it was a ton of code, I would direct them to #2. I felt OK with this small amount, but if we want to draw the line at any code, we can do #2. I believe sjc knows how to do this, but if you don\u0027t, reach out to me and I\u0027ll explain.",
