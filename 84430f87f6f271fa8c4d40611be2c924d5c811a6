      "message": "In libbinder and libbinder_ndk, these are public APIs and people can use them regardless of whether they use AIDL or not. Actually, I have thought that binder shouldn\u0027t assume that it is used only via the AIDL-generated code. i.e. we don\u0027t categories binder APIs into (1) those that are accessible to the AIDL clients, and (2) those that are visible only to the AIDL-generated code.\n\nI however don\u0027t know if we want to keep the same principle for the rust backend. I believe Steven has an authoritative answer here.",
