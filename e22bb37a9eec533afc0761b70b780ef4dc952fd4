      "message": "Ah, that reminds me that this operator does nothing when the builtin_vailable is evaluated to false at runtime. Such a fallback behavior would be very surprising to the client and very hard to debug. Such a case could happen when the client is built with sdk_version \u003e\u003d 31 but runs on a platform whose sdk_version \u003c 31 (but is greater than min_sdk_version of the client).\n\nI think that the \u0027else\u0027 part should also be implemented. We could abort or at least emit a log so that this is notified to the client.",
