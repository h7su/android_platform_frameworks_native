The old version of the code requires the object table to only contain FDs, so essentially protocol version 1 can only support FDs\n\nThis CL might require a protocol version bump. I\u0027m going to think about it more.\n\nAlso, from discussion with smoreland@ elsewhere, it would be nice if the tests could catch this. Would probably need to use old prebuilts somehow.",
