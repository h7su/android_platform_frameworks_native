      "message": "I think it could be confusing because it\u0027s not really doing anything, and we\u0027ll have actual versions elsewhere. If we do need a per-binder solution, maybe it will look like this (in which case we can revert this CL) or maybe a different solution will be needed. Dead code \u003d delete it. This simplifies (slightly) what is going on, removes noise. I would always remove code in this situation.",
