Could we instead have an explicit conversion method between either ASensorEvent-\u003esensors_event_t or ASensorEvent-\u003eEvent to help mitigate this since I don\u0027t think a static_assert would be feasible/enough.",

      "message": "I was assuming we keep them equivalent intentionally because we are already doing the same reinterpret_cast from ASensorEvent to sensor_event_t here for HIDL: https://source.corp.google.com/android/frameworks/native/services/sensorservice/hidl/utils.cpp;rcl\u003d952eb69223a0a6c6b4a8668d01f0b1ac8aa87178;l\u003d77\n\nBut I agree it would be better to have a shared conversion from one to the other!\nIs there an existing place that makes sense to add a conversion like that? As far as I can tell, these HIDL/AIDL sensorservices and libsensorndkbridge are the only places that use both of the types.\n\nAlso, WDYT about leaving this here and address it in a follow up CL? Since the HIDL version already does it.",
