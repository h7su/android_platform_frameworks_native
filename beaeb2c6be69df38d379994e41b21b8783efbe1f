If this code needs to be changed, it should be updated to use C++ string and file I/O classes.

      "message": "Hi Greg\nI may have miss something, however it seems to me that you suggestion does not work with a file that can have a string that is larger than 1024 bytes.\n\nandroid::base::ReadFileToString uses ReadFdToString do call to ReadFdToString to read from fd for a max of 1024 bytes, at least on M and N code base I have access to.\n\nSo I don\u0027t see how android::base::ReadFileToString is going to read the big string created by an atrace command that uses wildcards on kernel trace point.\n\nAre you referring to improvements made to ReadFileToString on very recent N release that makes ReadFileToString only limited by memory available when reading a string ?",
