      "message": "It\u0027s not really a corner case - kind of an omission. It depends on if another process calls getService at the same time. For instance, it was a case I orignally added in HIDL, but I\u0027m not sure why it wasn\u0027t added for the port. In HidlService::addClientCallback, this is done via forceHandleClientCallbacks (in the other order from here though, due to a few differences in how the two managers store the service).\n\nDue to how rare this race is, I missed it when I was deflaking this codebase (in http://r.android.com/2417920 and http://r.android.com/2568830). Hopefully this is the last (rare) issue.",
