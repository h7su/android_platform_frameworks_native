      "message": "This patch works reliably if I increase the retry.  On my device, it seems the worst case out of 10 runs requires 17 retries (mostly 10+).\n\nHaving said that, I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s a reasonable retry number in general. Eventually, our client code should coordinate the connection handshake better, so this wouldn\u0027t be super important.  But what should we do in the short term?",

That is expected as this retry loop is only supposed to be handling the case where the connection backlog is full. We don\u0027t want any polling in this system.",
