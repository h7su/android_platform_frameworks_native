      "message": "This patch works reliably if I increase the retry.  On my device, it seems the worst case out of 10 runs requires 17 retries (mostly 10+).\n\nHaving said that, I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s a reasonable retry number in general. Eventually, our client code should coordinate the connection handshake better, so this wouldn\u0027t be super important.  But what should we do in the short term?",
