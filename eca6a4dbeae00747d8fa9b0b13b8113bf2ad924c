      "message": "It\u0027d be fine to be borrow-only but sometimes borrow sometimes refcounted is not fine. I think this needs to be reconciled with the docs above that state:\n\n\"If this parcel object was originally an\n * AParcel object, the original object is returned. The returned object has one refcount\n * associated with it, and so this should be accompanied with an AParcel_decStrong call.\"\n\nIt needs to only have 1 memory model. I\u0027m not tied to which one it ends up with (it\u0027d be _better_ if all parcels were all a single refcounted thing though), but if needs to at least be consistent with itself. Particularly since I don\u0027t see how you could even handle this method sometimes being just a borrow and sometimes needing a delete, nothing tells you that?",
