      "message": "If we could remove \u0027mObitsSent\u0027, we could have added the boolean \u0027mDescriptorCache\u0027 without increasing the size of BpBinder. However - I went with the StaticString16 approach (which also makes use of the idea that a StaticString16 is not copied when set, but rather the underlying string is reacquired, an implementation detail of String16 - that we can do pointer equality here). However - it does have the nice property that we can get rid of the other prints, since printing the uninitialized descriptor will print something nice. I\u0027m happy with the implementation.",
