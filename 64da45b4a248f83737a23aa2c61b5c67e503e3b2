AFAICT it doesn\u0027t care if the input string is null-terminated, and always adds another null-terminator in the call to utf8_to_utf16.",

      "message": "This is reasonable from a Rust point of view, but only if we know the NDK will always allow strings with NULL in the middle. If the documented interface doesn\u0027t guarantee that, I\u0027m hesitant to make that assumption in the Rust bindings, even if it would make things cleaner.\n\nsmoreland@ can probably speak better to whether this is a reasonable assumption about the NDK.",
