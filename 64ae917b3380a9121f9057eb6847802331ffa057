      "message": "Actually, I would prefer to merge this if you are okay to help with development (I can remove it later if you want).\n\nThe motivation of the API is that it allows a developer to understand the stability of an interface, but it doesn\u0027t expose the stability. I don\u0027t want to expose the stability since people might write code that depends on a certain stability level. Right now, we have the option to merge stability classes without breaking code.\n\nDo you have a better idea for an API or are you okay with this?",
