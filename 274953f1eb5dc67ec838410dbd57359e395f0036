I\u0027ve sent that patch to point out the problem (and potentially give a temporary solution to people) more than having it merged as is.\n\nAlso, the build system, AFAIK, doesn\u0027t have any facility to create symlinks and several, though not a huge number, makefiles duplicate the echo/mkdir/ln sequence.",
