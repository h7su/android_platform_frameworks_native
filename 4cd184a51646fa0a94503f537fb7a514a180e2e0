      "message": "Just compile or also run it? Would Soong build a libbinder_nothreads without anything using it?\n\nI was thinking of adding a single-threaded binderRpcTest but afaict that would require the following:\n* build a no-threads version of libbinder (as a static library?)\n* refactor or rewrite binderRpcTest into a subset that supports no-threads\n* build and run single-threaded binderRpcTest\n\nDoes that sound about right? Would it make sense to do it?",
