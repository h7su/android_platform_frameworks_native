      "message": "yeah - I think we could also include more information in AParcelableHolder, or we could include the cached descriptor for IInterface. I would probably just change these locally whenever I needed the information and upload a patch, or we can do it a solid now. Let me see if this is failing the netd tests though - I\u0027m expecting it to fail those tests first - and part of the reason I did this was to make it easier to add a silly exception there, but once I know what it fails, I can update this.",
