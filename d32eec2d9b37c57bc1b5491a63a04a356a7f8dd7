      "message": "No, this *is* the fix. The LOG_FATAL in the dexopt() code actually isn\u0027t a LOG(FATAL) - because that\u0027s frameworks logging which isn\u0027t doing anything in NDEBUG (the right thing would have been LOG_ALWAYS_FATAL, because of course there needs to be two versions...), so of course we didn\u0027t notice this going wrong. So when I switched to CHECK, it actually broke.\n\nThis mask is supposed to have all flags dexopt() can see - and this is certainly such a flag.",
