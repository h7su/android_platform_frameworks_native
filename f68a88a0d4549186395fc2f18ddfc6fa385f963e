In case of HIDL, there were some IPCs which would basically block forever until some work was available (not a great idea...). I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there\u0027s more of those.\n\nI also think gaillard@ once worked on a dashboard to visualize binder call execution times? Might be easier to monitor that.\n\n",
