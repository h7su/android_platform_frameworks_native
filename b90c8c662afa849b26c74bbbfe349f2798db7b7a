      "message": "Rather than shelling out to it on demand, we can check the files in and also update Android\u0027s UPDATING script to include cmake in the list of things generated.\n\nAnd then at some point all the disparate CMake builds will be unified, but *hopefully* we can avoid breaking you.\n\nTo that end, will this build be covered by any sort of CI on Android?",

I would be a little worried about android-cmake vs cmake variant, but when I run the former `external/boringssl/CMakeLists.txt` doesn\u0027t get touched, so I suppose it\u0027s fine.\n\nYes, Linux Binder is planned to be covered under CI.",

      "message": "Yeah, we have far too many CMake builds. It\u0027s a huge mess, initially caused by the Perl and Go deps. I think android-cmake is used by the emulator folks and just generates some source lists. This one was originally used by gRPC and generates a top-level file.\n\n(TBH, I suspect when I finally clean this up, there\u0027ll be options like one of the CLs you all sent. But I figure this build is probably better for you in the meantime anyway. ðŸ˜Š Specifically, it avoids the Go and Perl dep. The cleaned up version will avoid that too.)",
