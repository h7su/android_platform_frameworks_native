      "message": "Hi Gavin and Shai, this change adds some preprocessor directives to avoid needing to update the vendor API surface, which was a second change that was origally needed to pass internal presubmit (ag/24245852)\n\nWith this change, we can keep the dumpstate changes self-contained without the   internal ABI dump prebuilt update.\n\nWhen this change is cherry-picked to udc-d1-dev, it should be submitted as a relation chain with ag/24241899 as its parent.\n\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/vndk/build-system#conditional-compilation",
