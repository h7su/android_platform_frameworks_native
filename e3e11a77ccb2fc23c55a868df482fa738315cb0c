      "message": "This is but one spot in _many_ that is begging for a cleanup IMHO.\n\nAINPUT_EVENT_TYPE_MOTION is defined in android/input.h for all low level C functions and NDK support, and is not directly used to derive InputMessage::TYPE_MOTION in input/InputTransport.h. I consider that a risk since there are no comments indicating that one depends on the other to mitigate (I understand why it is missing in android/input.h because such messages do not belong in an NDK).\n\nI half expected instead that InputTransport.h to include the input.h, and do things like \u0027TYPE_MOTION \u003d AINPUT_EVENT_TYPE_MOTION,\u0027 ... We do this in other places in the code tree, why not in InputTransport.h? Then it is an easy low-risk stance that all C files use the macro, all C++ using the class.\n\nStandalone, this is movement forward, but I would like to see a more substantive clearing of the technical debt.",
