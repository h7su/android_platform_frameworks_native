Otherwise, we will attribute too many samples to the largest bucket.\n\nWould you be so kind as to do this? Otherwise, I can open an internal issue.",

That means we\u0027re going to have to tweak max_time_bucket to the nearest multiple of num_buckets when the user sets it to a value that isn\u0027t divisible, though. I figured dropping the excess in the last bucket (making that bucket a bit bigger) was better than changing the value on the user, but I\u0027m fine either way.",
