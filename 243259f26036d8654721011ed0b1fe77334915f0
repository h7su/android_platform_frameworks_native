Traceur app will continue to have permission (just as it always did). \n\nHistory: per-file selinux labeling of debugfs/tracefs is fairly new. As recently as Android M access control on debugfs was only possible through Unix permissions. Moving to selinux makes permissions static, and testing in CTS trivial.",
