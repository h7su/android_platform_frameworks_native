I kind of like having the variable, since it\u0027s not obvious what `VsyncController::addPresentFence` returns (without looking up the method). Maybe replace it with a comment? Something like:\n\n```\nif (schedule-\u003egetController().addPresentFence(std::move(fence))) {\n    // The model needs more signals to make an accurate prediction, so ensure\n    // that hw VSYNC is enabled.\n```\n\n?",
