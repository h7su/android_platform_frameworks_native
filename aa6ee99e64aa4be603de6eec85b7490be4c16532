      "message": "I tend to agree it\u0027s not necessary; my guess is the binaries refer to binaries we don\u0027t have source to ourselves; if they are linked against the current version of libbinder and have a class that inherits from BHwBinder (all Stub classes do), we can\u0027t just add another virtual member here without breaking stuff.\n\nDianne, are you ok with removing SHELL_COMMAND_TRANSACTION here?",
