      "message": "Hello I found a few issues in EventHub when using some USB touchpanels in a multi-display automotive setup where we were using the same display/touchpanel for multiple screens. The fixes for these looked fairly straight forward so I thought I would share this back upstream in case it will help others that run into the same issue. Let me know if there are any questions or clarifications needed. I tried to put some examples of the issue in the commit message to help clarify the problem I was running into. Thanks in advance for the help reviewing this.",
