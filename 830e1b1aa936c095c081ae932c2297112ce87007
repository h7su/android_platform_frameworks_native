      "message": "I agree this is a much more accurate way of computing the percentiles. This also works great on my Pixel device. I do have a couple of minor suggestions:\n\n1. Can we split this patch? I see ~3 patches: e.g. (1) \"argv bound check\", (2) \"warmup rounds\", (3) new post-compute procedure.\n\n2. I think we can (maybe should?) keep the max latency option. To help determine the number of `m_long_transactions` that exceeded the limit. This should be orthogonal to your patch here?\n\n3. I read through the test source and I have a couple of changes (mostly cosmetic) that I\u0027ll be uploading. We should coordinate the rebase, I\u0027m fine either way.",
