      "message": "The aim of this change is just to make it easier to refactor code under packages/modules/Virtualization. I am not introducing any new dependencies on libbinder_rpc_unstable.\n\nAnswering your question:\n1. code under packages/modules/Virtualization/javalib/jni is jni code running on host to establish rpc binder over vsock between host app and VM.\n2. code under packages/modules/Virtualization/vm_payload is rust code in a VM to establish the same rpc binder over vsock from VM pov.\n3. code under packages/modules/Virtualization/demo_native is an example of how to start a VM from C++.\n\nI don\u0027t think that (1) and (2) can be easily done as a single library. Likewise, since (1) has a bunch of jni-specific stuff, I am not sure that (3) can easily reuse it.",
