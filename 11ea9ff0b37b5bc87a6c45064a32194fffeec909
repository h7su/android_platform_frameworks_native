      "message": "The only trick I can think of is to use a built style configuration (see  the `custom_bindgen` property on the `rust_bindgen` module), and then put the configuration into a `.rs` file rather than flags.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is worth the extra complexity, but it would let them share a file.\n\nIf you do come up with a reasonable way to do this, I have a use for something very close to this so please let me know. (I want a single file which gets used by make, Soong, and Bazel to set flags for a particular build step.)",

      "message": "Another way could be to store the arguments in a file and pass that in, but that hasn\u0027t been implemented yet (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1898).\n\nA hackier approach could be to put all the flags into a text file and import them into each build system. Make can definitely do that e.g. `MODULE_BINDGEN_FLAGS +\u003d $(shell cat bindgen_flags.txt)`, but I\u0027m not sure how it would work in Soong.\n\nI\u0027ll try out the `custom_bindgen` approach, wrapping bindgen in a script was my initial idea but thought it was too hacky (and didn\u0027t know Soong supported that). Afaik the Trusty build system doesn\u0027t have an equivalent, but I could always add it.",
