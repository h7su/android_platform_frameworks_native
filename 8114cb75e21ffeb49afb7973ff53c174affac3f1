      "message": "The biggest difference between `OwnedFd` and `File` is that the former does not implement the `Read` and `Write` traits. If you want to use those, you have to convert using `From\u003cOwnedFd\u003e for File` (which is clunky if you start with a reference).",

      "message": "I advocated for this over the Trusty split b/c I don\u0027t think this should have been a File in the first place.\n\nFile is for objects which are bufferable, can be read/written through arbitrary read/write sequencing, etc.\n\nParcelFileDescriptor is frequently used with ashmem/ion_buffer/pipe/socket/memfd/etc. which may not implement the right methods for File to work correctly, and may need other methods to be exposed. I\u0027ve definitely seen people call `as_raw_fd` to get the fd back out of the `File`, which was a bit of a warning sign, but it didn\u0027t seem worth the shakeup. The Trusty needs just kind of push things over the line such that I\u0027d advocate for us fixing this API.",
