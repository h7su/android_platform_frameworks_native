      "message": "Although switching to gbenchmark probably makes sense, this is a 6 month old change that was forgotten. Would you be okay with merging the current implementation strategy, considering that it is an improvement over the status quo? We can always switch to gbenchmark later.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think this changes the meanings of the results. It just makes the results not be wrong when the maximum latency is large.",
