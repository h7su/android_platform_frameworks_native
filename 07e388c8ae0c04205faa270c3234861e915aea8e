      "message": "If it\u0027s called later, a threadpool will be started, but it may be smaller than expected. Regardless, link_to_death _should_ still work, but there may be more contention.\n\nNote - specifically this case becomes racey when this is called late:\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/native/libs/binder/ProcessState.cpp;l\u003d193;drc\u003d3e9debc9b6054336d3a54272237aa3726ff53a9d\n\nWDYT about avoiding the specific example, and just saying it should be called first, or mentioning specifically that fewer threads than requested may be startable?",

      "message": "From my experience I found that if `start_thread_pool` is not called then `link_to_death` doesn\u0027t work at all; there\u0027s no error or even warning, the death recipient just never gets called. This was a surprising and confusing bug that took a while to find, as I didn\u0027t expect to need to start a thread pool just for an AIDL client to work. I\u0027d like to prevent other people from wasting their time on similar issues.\n\nI call out `link_to_death` specifically because everything else seemed to work fine without a thread pool in that case. Are there other things worth mentioning here that will also break without a threadpool?",
