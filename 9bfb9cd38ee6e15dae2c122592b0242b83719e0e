      "message": "For Binder case, we will need at least one binder inside the random parcel to pass. Other type of data can be constructed for any type of available data in parcel. This still might not fix the flakes as this really depends on the input data which is being generated. One solution will be to provide seed for binder case which can fill in random parcel with a binder each time but this will defeat the purpose of this test.",
