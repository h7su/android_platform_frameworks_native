      "message": "FWIW - I do kind of like this because it\u0027s much closer to reality/how code would be written. I really wish we could have \u0027status_t\u0027 as a type separate from \u0027int32_t\u0027 so that we could automatically print the right representation, but C++ typedefs are just silly renames ðŸ˜ž\n\nSo, I guess I really wish we had:\n\nstruct status_t { int32_t value; };\n\nThen we could really overload this, but alas we are stuck w/ the complicated matcher format :(\n\nAnyway, thanks for making the error better!",
