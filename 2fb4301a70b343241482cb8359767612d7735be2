Would be nice if the `status_t -\u003e ssize` conversion was a warning, but I guess that isn\u0027t possible since android seems to have designed `status_t` to be compatible with libc return values.\n\nWould it be reasonable to catch this path in a unit test?",

One way to do that would be to close the channel early on the service side, but I\u0027m not sure how to do that without tampering with libbinder internals.",
