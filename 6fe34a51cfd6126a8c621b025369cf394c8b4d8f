      "message": "Drive-by side note: This logic is doing what we want, but perhaps not entirely for the reasons we might have expected.\n\n\"min_new_classes_percent_change \u003e\u003d 0\" is always true, because min_new_classes_percent_change is unsigned.  This first check is _not_ catching the case of us getting the default value of -1.  However, the \"min_new_classes_percent_change \u003c\u003d 100\" does end up catching this correctly, as uint32_t(-1) wraps around to a value much larger than 100.\n\nWe don\u0027t need to change this here (especially because it will create merge problems for this cherry-pick).  But just something to keep in mind in the future when using unsigned values and trying to catch a negative default value.",
