It turns out that we\u0027ve already landed a similar patch internally earlier this year for associating joysticks with a display.\n\nI will try to get it landed in AOSP as well: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/2184671/\n\nSorry for the churn!\n\nPrabir",

That would be great to have.\n\nYou could either wait for that CL to land and then sync and adapt this change on top of it, or download that CL and rebase your patch to be on top of it, and re-upload both.",
