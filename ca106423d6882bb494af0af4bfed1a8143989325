Which I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s present or not - can you have the AIDL compiler set its version as a define somewhere so you can ifdef against that? Otherwise you\u0027ll be holding on to legacy things you don\u0027t need for a heck of a lot longer than you otherwise need to\n\nOr just slap a [[deprecated]] on it and call it good enough for any non-aidl users?",
