      "message": "It was very difficult for me to understand this change (actually the entire ref count mechanism for rpc) and I am not sure if my understanding is correct. Is there a good documentation that describes the mechanism?\n\nAll I could find was the following paragraph in the original design doc:\n\n\"Whenever a binder object is sent to another process (either as the target of a transaction OR as an argument of a transaction) this comes with an implicit strong refcount to the binder. RpcSession on the receiving side holds this object internally as a BpBinder and will immediately send transactions to decrement any extra strong refcounts they own. When a BpBinder object is dropped completely, the last strong refcount command will be sent over the wire, and the object will be deleted.\"\n\nWhat I don\u0027t understand is this part: \n\n\"and will immediately send transactions to decrement any extra strong refcounts they own\"\n\nWhat defines \u0027extra\u0027? If we are to decrement immediately why haven\u0027t we not incremented when sending? ",
