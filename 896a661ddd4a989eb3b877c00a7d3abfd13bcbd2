      "message": "Like some enums in `ANativeWindow`, unsure if it makes sense to insert an `_` to separate the type from the enum-name? Like `ASurfaceTransaction_Visibility`.\n\nAre there any high-level guidelines that we can also retroactively apply?",

      "message": "The rule is a little loose (the doc is hosted internally, so copying here):\n\n\u003e “Nested” classes should also follow a `AClassName_SubType` naming convention\n\nThis certainly could be `android::SurfaceTransaction::Visibility`, but it also could be `android::SurfaceTransactionVisibility`, so /shrug.\n\nI looked around and saw a mix of both formats used in this project, so \"don\u0027t argue with existing style\" doesn\u0027t work. @jreck@google.com is more familiar with this project than I am. Maybe he has a preference.",

      "message": "I\u0027d argue that `SurfaceTransactionVisibility` sounds as if it is about the `Visibility` of a transaction (which has no meaning) rather than an argument to the `SurfaceTransaction` API to change the `Visibility` of a `SurfaceControl`, just like the internally-documented doc suggests to separate them.\n\n(I guess namespaces won\u0027t work for C files though)\n\nOn the note of this API, anyone who could help me out with https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/320706287?",
