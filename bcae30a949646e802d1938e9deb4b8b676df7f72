      "message": "I saw failing tests related to this CL yesterday and it looks like because of missing of this CL on udc-dev-plus-aosp branch (example failing build: https://android-build.corp.google.com/artifact/pending/P60169852/aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-trunk_staging-userdebug_coverage/latest/view/logs%2Fbuild_error.log). But the tests are pass now after I re-running the resubmits today.\n\nIt looks like there are problems that auto-merger didn\u0027t merge the whole topic atomically to the udc-tv-plus-aosp branch, but eventually succeeded later. Probably related to recently trunk stable migration? I don\u0027t know. But looks like we don\u0027t need this revert now, or you are seeing other failures?",
