      "message": "Heh indeed my actual goal is to get rid of exact duplicates.  \n\nI did misunderstand your point though, didn\u0027t I? You meant that we should print the time that we waited when the service came up?  Probably best to print the \u0027Waiting for service\u0027 line then a subsequent one that tells you how long we did wait, right?\n\nAnd that would solve the more sensible goal of reducing log spam.\n\n\u003e is _that_ the real bug then? aiui tomcherry\u0027s saying he *always* sees this?\n\nYes, I always see this during boot.  There\u0027s an explicit switch to make the retry period shorter before boot complete has happened, so it does look like there\u0027s at least some acknowledgement that this will be called during boot for services that are still coming up.",
