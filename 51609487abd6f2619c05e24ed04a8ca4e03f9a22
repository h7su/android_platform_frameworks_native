I\u0027ve reached out to the test owner (+cc rhedjao@) and it was confirmed that this change was unrelated to the test case. In addition, this test failure doesn\u0027t seem to be locally reproducible on aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-userdebug/aosp-master-with-phones.\n\n(The AOSP branch that\u0027s failing in presubmit is actually aosp-master, but I believe this is the same as aosp-master-with-phones).",
