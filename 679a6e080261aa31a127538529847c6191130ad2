      "message": "I mean, when you getService, you might have the permission to `find` \u0027foo/bar\u0027 but not \u0027foo/baz\u0027. So, we can\u0027t return any information about \u0027baz\u0027. For instance, if this error string was reported back to the client as \u0027error\u0027 with `Status::from*(*, \u003cerror\u003e)`, then it would reveal information at runtime about \u0027baz\u0027 to a client that doesn\u0027t have permission to view baz.\n\nHowever, since this is a log, it\u0027s okay. What I was asking for is a comment like \"// for logging, not to return to client since includes information to other services\"\n\nThough I\u0027m realizing now, I might have read this a bit too quickly, and since this is VINTF info - it\u0027s statically available, not information about the services running, so it\u0027s less interesting, not very critical, may already be available, so maybe it\u0027s not worth calling out.",
