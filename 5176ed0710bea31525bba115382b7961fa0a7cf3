      "message": "This is WIP change for binder/fd support. \n- For some binders, ex defaultServiceManager(), no metadata is being recorded. binderRecordReplay tests needs modification so that saved and read object data can be checked. We would be able to save object metadata which is recorded inside parcel here: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/libs/binder/Parcel.cpp;l\u003d1711;drc\u003d639490b9ec6535cda7f24403237355c941e9fcb2 Again, this doesn\u0027t necessarily captures every object.\n- binder2corpus need to read this metadata and generate seeds with it.\n- fuzzService modifications are needed so that we can replace the objects with random objects in Parcel data buffer. Using existing getRandomBinder and getRandomFd are maintainable options but using those will make seed generation more complex.",
