      "message": "mmap isn\u0027t terribly slow.\n\nThere are two considerations that lead me to keep it as-is:\n\n1. The analysis relies on the ability to read a single RecordedTransaction starting from the current fd position. Specifically, the listen subcommand reads continually from the end of the file. So a single mmap would require additional paths and other refactors.\n\n2. If we have a very large recording, a full mmap could be a problem on 32-bit systems. While the whole file isn\u0027t loaded, I believe mmap allocates memory for it and uses page faults to decide when to reconcile memory with disk.\n\nPerhaps this is worth a follow-up issue, especially to consider the performance and decide if such a refactor is worthwhile.",
