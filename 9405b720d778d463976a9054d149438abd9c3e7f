      "message": "Hi @svv@google.com and @joseprio@google.com, as we discussed offline, using a blocklist for non-keyboard devices that registering keyboard interface could be a tempo solution.\n\nI found that chromos is maintaining a blocklist for the same reason b/191897198, and I\u0027m coping it to eventhub.\n\nBy removing the keyboard interface from eventhub, will disable any key from non-keyboard devices. I would need some input on how much impact would it do and whether it\u0027s the right direction to implement the blocklist.",
