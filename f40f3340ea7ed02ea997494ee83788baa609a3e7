We need an API to tell code how big of allocations are definitely a problem. Allocations at least of this size need to be let through because they might not result in a transaction failure. This value is determined approximately by the binder buffer size. However, there is some margin of error there because large allocations fail anyway with a high probability. Right now this value is specified inside and outside the NDK API surface. We would like to specify it one time inside the API surface so that is adjacent (and therefore updatable with, as necessary, but not now) to the value it is coupled to (the binder VM size).\n\nWe originally suggested doing this beneath the specific semantics of resizing a vector. Now, it is suggested to export the exact value. Honestly, I do not care which way it is done between these two. Though, we are comfortable exposing the value, it has a specific semantic, and it may be useful in the future. So, it\u0027s okay.\n\n\u003e I was imagining that Parcel would actually restrict itself to the specified size\n\nThis is unrelated to the behavior that is needed or the requirement here, and it reflects a miscommunication between the name I suggested (\"allocation limit\") and other possible interpretations of it. Any time spent further down this line is unrelated to this issue. If such a feature was needed for another reason, we could implement it (not unreasonable, only irrelevant).\n\nI now suggest distinguishing the name to approach the relevant semantic:\n\n    /** The absolute maximum size a Parcel could be and succeed when sent in a transaction, even if it is unreasonable to send Parcels of this size. This can be used to limit writes to the Parcel. Rather than allocating or making a write of this size, it is always safe to consider a transaction containing this amount of data to fail without trying to send it. */\n    size_t AParcel_getTransactionSizeHardLimit(...)",

The reason we focused on an AParcel API is that there is no guarantee of having an AIBinder in the context (the C++ API AParcel_resize(Out)Vector) where this is needed.

In some cases, if markForRpc is called, we only have the RpcSession, no longer the specific binder.\n\nThis limit makes sense for any user of Parcel. Having a limit is definitely needed for any unparceling to avoid OOM conditions, and 1MB (or 2MB or 10MB - it really is quite arbitrary since it\u0027s only catching an extreme condition) is a perfectly fine limit. If a higher limit is needed elsewhere, we can add it. However, this C++ API (resizeOutVector) is used in unparceling C++ out vectors, and context-independent (though any other user is unexpected) this needs a limit, and 1MB is reasonable for that (if you don\u0027t think so, please provide a counterexample).",
