      "message": "I moved the OS-specific code into `newFactory`. I left that function in the common header, but we could just declare it there and move the body into the `.cpp` files.\n\nWe do have one problem there: Trusty doesn\u0027t include the `include_tls` headers, so types like `RpcAuth` and `RpcCertificateVerifier` are not available there. I got away with just removing them from the Trusty definition, but I\u0027m open to alternatives.",

      "message": "I see the dependency structure is already sort of inverted. It would be nicer if we avoid ifdefs - so that compiling the header in either situation provides the hooks to attach arbitrary functionality. Otherwise, you need to validate common code changes even compile with every possible arg.\n\nWe have to use ifdef for the core binder code, due to an inability to change it, but we should avoid it here.",
