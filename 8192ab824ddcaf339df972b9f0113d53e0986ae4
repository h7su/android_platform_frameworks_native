      "message": "Pierre-Hugues:\n\nThanks for your contribution.\n\nThis change may not be that useful. IIRC input device \u0026 display binding are for the time being only written in a config file OEM makes, so OEM can make sure the input device in interest always has location. What is the situation you need to fix?\n\nI might well be wrong so I\u0027ll still defer this to either svv@, lzye@ or michaelwr@.",

      "message": "Right, \u0027inputPort\u0027 actually means the port that the device is plugged in.\n\nFor bluetooth devices, my suggestion was that the bluetooth stack somehow comes up with \u0027port\u0027 concept. Maybe something like a \u0027bluetooth controller number\u0027?\n\nWhat is the actual desired UX here? Why do you want to associate a bluetooth device with a specific screen rather than just let the focused events go to the currently focused display?",
