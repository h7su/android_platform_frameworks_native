(These will be ~hourly on dogfooder devices, but ~daily on other devices.)\n\nThe skip logic here was added since on a typical droidfood device including the _wtf and _strictmode logs would add ~5MiB (compressed!) to the size of the bugreport, and those flavor of issues are already triaged via other pipelines.\n\nThe other remaining entries (like event_data) are much smaller in size, which is why I ignored them here.",
