OEM can put it in the device makefile, like https://osscs.corp.google.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:device/google/sunfish/device.mk;l\u003d269?q\u003dsunfish%2Fdevice.mk.\n\nApparently AOSP is using vendor.img prebuilt (https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/android-chatty-eng/c/KvABAthYufs/m/PGZtuGssBQAJ). Thus I did the validation on internal-master.\n\n\u003e Also, let\u0027s make sure at the same time it doesn\u0027t auto-opt people in before U\n\nVerified it by running CTS(aosp/2258806) on sunfish. The feature flag does not exist and all kernel migration tests are skipped.",
