If that\u0027s the case, how does that service actually get the app\u0027s sockets to tag them, and how does it differentiate them enough to tag them usefully?\n\nOr is this only for tagging sockets used by system processes, and services are expected to tag their own sockets?\n\nAside from the new question the doc update does help, thanks!",
