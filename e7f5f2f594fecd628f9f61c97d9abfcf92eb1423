      "message": "The tests are part of the stack (or at least were at some point, I need to rebase them):\n* https://r.android.com/2584776 adds a basic Rust client on Trusty. It\u0027s very minimal, but it might be useful as a smoke test. There is an open comment there whether we should also run it on Android?\n* https://r.android.com/2700753 adds a corresponding Rust test service (parts of BinderRpcTest in Rust). Same question applies: would this be useful on Android?\n* https://r.android.com/2876734 adds more of binderRpcTestService.\n\nFor starters, these would test Trusty-Trusty and Android-Android. We could also run them Trusty-Android, but libbinder_ndk_vendor might be a blocker there (if we have to run the Rust test client in vendor).",
