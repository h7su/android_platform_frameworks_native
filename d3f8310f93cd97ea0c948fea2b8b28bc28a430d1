      "message": "Yes, after applying this patch, I found that the blurring effect is better than before. I\u0027m not sure whether this is a custom adjustment based on Kawase algorithm on the engineering side. I can\u0027t see either of the two patches in the comments here. Could you please help me check it? Thanks!",

      "message": "From [this comment](https://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/3019150/comments/a90bfc56_851a9f01) - we already used `radiusByPasses * kInputScale` for `in_blurOffset` on line 109, so why do we start with `i \u003d\u003d 1`, effectively using the same value again?\n\nUnless I\u0027m missing something, we\u0027ve roughly used this behavior since this code was introduced in I459780d9fd408865d1d9713f37bf308f07c4fdfc, though the code has changed quite a bit since then. It *may* be that this was the behavior in `GLESRenderEngine`, though I haven\u0027t checked. ( @alecmouri@google.com, perhaps you remember?)\n\nI\u0027m not familiar with this algorithm, so I don\u0027t know whether starting with `i` of `2` is more correct (though it seems believable), but I think it would at least change the way the blur looks. @linkai@xiaomi.com, do you notice a difference in appearance or performance?\n\n@johnstiles@google.com, I think you advised me on the \"ping pong\" approach here, introduced in I7ad2438a0e5d9e437b0256eb302fe2fd44e9c093. Does this CL look right?",
