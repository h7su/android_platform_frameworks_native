      "message": "It looks like _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_INCOMPLETE_FORMAT was removed from libc++ in https://reviews.llvm.org/D150802, but that\u0027s newer than the current clang-r498229b prebuilt. The upcoming clang-r510928 prebuilt lacks this macro.\n\nlibc++\u0027s macro name confused me a bit. I think it means, \"suppress the incomplete \u003cformat\u003e in libc++\". If the macro is defined, then \u003cformat\u003e\u0027s contents are empty:\n\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/14f0776550b5a49e1c42f49a00213f7f3fa047bf/libcxx/include/format#L176\n\nOnce \u003cformat\u003e in libc++ is complete (i.e. after May 2023 or so in upstream libc++),  then the macro is not defined, and it\u0027s OK to include \u003cformat\u003e.",

I really think it\u0027s a waste of time to have to deal with the complexities of importing a new version of a new way of doing formatting when we have a perfectly good way of doing it from the past, and we may need to rip it out anyway to make these binaries smaller, but we\u0027ll see. It would decouple the two projects.",
